# Livpure Reviews Sentiment Analysis ðŸš€

Unlock the power of sentiment analysis! Dive into Livpure customer reviews and discover insights with cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- textblob
- spacy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk textblob spacy tensorflow matplotlib

ðŸ“¥ Installation
1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/livpure-reviews-sentiment-analysis.git

2.Navigate to the project folder:

cd livpure-reviews-sentiment-analysis

3.Execute the sentiment analysis script or notebook.

ðŸ“Š Data Import and Preprocessing

Import Livpure reviews data from the provided CSV file using pandas.
Handle missing values in the dataset.
Perform robust text preprocessing, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, chat word translation, spelling correction, stop words removal, lemmatization, and tokenization.

ðŸ§  Model Building
Leverage the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network architecture for sentiment classification.
Tokenize and pad sequences to ensure uniform input length.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Construct the LSTM model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train and validate the model on the training data, and assess performance through accuracy and loss metrics visualization.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Witness the LSTM model in action! Achieve remarkable accuracy and loss metrics on the validation set, demonstrating superior sentiment classification capabilities.
