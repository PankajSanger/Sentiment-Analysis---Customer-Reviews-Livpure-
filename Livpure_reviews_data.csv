"Pros Effectively removes impurities from water, providing clean and safe drinking water.Multi-stage filtration system ensures thorough water purification.Sleek and compact design fits well in various kitchen spaces.Easy installation and maintenance.Taste enhancer improves the taste of purified water.
Cons Filters need to be replaced frequently, which can add to the overall cost.Flow rate can be a bit slow at times.
Overall The Livpure GLO PRO++ RO+UV+UF+Taste Enhancer is a good water purifier that provides clean and safe drinking water. However, the frequent replacement of filters can be a drawback. If you are looking for a water purifier that offers effective filtration and a sleek design, the Livpure GLO PRO++ RO+UV+UF+Taste Enhancer is a good option to consider. However, be prepared for the additional cost of frequent filter replacements.",1
Nice product. Feels like drinking fresh water after long time,1
"Purchased Glo Pro ++ purifier. Delivery is fast with Amazon prime in a day. After a week usage, giving review.Product is looking cute & small with 7L capacity. It will take 30 minutes to full tank. Tap water coming fast and clean.
Cons: Need to purchase external filter separately for 1200 rupees including service charges. Observed a small crack on the outer dom even though packing was good. Got to know from technician that every year this needs maintenance around4000 rupees.Overall happy to purchase the LivPure.",1
Good product for a small family but the installation experience is pathetic,1
"Water quality is good after filtering and TDS is also lower than 50. But this product has quality control issues, the material is of very cheap quality. Service costs a minimum of 500 rupees.Filtration capacity is also on the lower side.",0
Installation was smooth. Water does not taste that good,0
Superb product in 10k price range.thank you,1
"After buying the product, sales rep will say main extranal filter is not added in the price. So water purifier will damage faster if don't buy extranal water filter. This is the way Livpure cheating us.",0
Pre filter not available with pack. They didn't think pre filter as a part of filtration process.,0
"But water tap in annoying, didn't like it.",0
"I had bought livpure glopro++ water purifier about 8 months back. The price of the filter is pretty less compared to other RO filter brands like kent, aquaguard, ao smith, etc. The reason I am rating it low are:
1. They do not provide all the required parts in the kit that they are selling in amazon. I had to pay Rs. 1300 extra for the iron filter which is practically the first filter required in any RO filter and fitting pipe which will be connected the inlet.
2. The 1 year service warranty is for repairing of any eletcrical fualts. If any of the 6 filters fitted inside malfunctions , you have to pay for the spare part
3. Even though you get 3 free services within warranty, then won't do it proactively which is generally done by other companies where they clean your filter.
4. You won't get any complimentary filter change. Even the basic iron filter, within the warranty period won't be chnaged
5. My filter malfunctioned and when the service person came he said that two of the filters were malfunctioning and needs to eb changed. Surprisingly, I had to pay for the parts since these were not covered under warranty.
They will ask you to take and AMC which will cover the charges for all filters and parts but it will cost you ?5500 Per year. You can do the math and understand that the overall cost will be at par or more than other brands if you for this.Therfore, buy a kent, aquaguard or other brand but not livpure. I guess the rental option is better for Livpure. You get free maintance and repair and pay for the volume of water you consume.",0
"My initial impression is that it has an aesthetically pleasing body structure, enhanced water taste, and quiet operation. The build quality is also commendable. I recommend considering it.The installation fee is ?1050, and while the installation itself is free, there is an additional cost of ?1000 for the external filter.",1
It is good but this one basic model...better buy high-end model...,1
"Writing this review after using one year, this product is nice in this price range. Best part is that livepure service is awesome. I'm very happy to buy this product.",1
"Crons: high noise level while filtering
No water level indicator (shows only when full)
Water storage is done on plastic. But didn't look high quality and finishing..
Taste enhancer the control should be outside.",0
It's a good product. Can improve the quality of tap for taking water from filter. Easy to break.,1
"I really liked the service.The livpure glopro++ is the really good.You can see the difference in the water, due to some construction work in our neighbourhood the water in the bucket is the water we've been getting and it was challenging our health. I found this RO and I'm not getting regretting it, just look at the water it filtered. And yes The taste has enhanced, as mentioned.
Thank you Livpure.",1
"I have ordered past month of this product but they dilivered poor quality and copied product .Finishing is not good and scraches on front and very light weight product.
And second time ordered anather account of this product so this products finishing is very ossom and hi weight product and packaging next level.So must buy but any doubts first return.Thank you",1
"No TDS adjuster and no installation manual and warranty card inside the box as mentioned during sale.
The cover had paint marks on the inside.Hope it's new. My earlier Pep+ model did not have such issues.",0
"Very decent product and working is very good.
Happy with the outcome.",1
Water output is pretty good considering the investment. Also the noise coming out of it is pretty low.,1
I would say this is the best purifier from livpure and best for middle class families,1
"I am writing after using 1.5yr around . Worst product. No service support . Whenever we call for service request we have beg behind them . But after warranty time period they spoke well and made us to take AMC for 4.5k . After that again original faced revealed . I requested for service request . Machine not working asked to come around 15days it is now ( 2/04/24) agent saying no spare parts .so wait .got exhausted .
Never purchase these type of items .",0
"Well Free installation..
Additional filter was costly,you should buy it from market
Since 2 months... performing well,,better water taste.
Sufficient storage capacity, it wastes about 3 times water during filtration.
I will review it's Performance and maintenance later.... after using it for year or more",1
"Nice product, working properly. Easy to use. Excellent delevery and installation .",1
Water quality of ro is good now how much longer filter membrane work.,1
Ease of use.. Faster installation good quality,1
"Good product, servicing is also good
Must buy",1
very good product and service....#Livpure,1
4 month ho gye abhi tak to shi chal rha h...product ach h jarur le,1
It's operation is very simple. Taste of the water is fine.,1
As of now the product is working absolutely fine. We shall recommend to buy it,1
"It's been 6 months since I'm using this water purifier. I had to install two pre-filters separately which coasted me around 600. There are few points i would like to mention about this-

1) Water Quality and Output: Sometimes we gets dirty water (little bit yellowish) at my place. The water purification of this water purifier is good and I've no doubt in that. It has 7 liter inbuilt water tank which takes around 40-45 minutes to fill it completely. TDS of water can be adjusted by service engineer.
2) Water Wastage: It wastes around 12-17liter water in process of producing 7 liter filtered water.
3) Warranty: This is where I got fooled. This water purifier comes with 1 year domestic warranty but please be aware that Internal filters such as Sediment Filter, Pre-Activated Carbon Filter, Anti-Scalant Cartridge, Reverse Osmosis Membrane, UF Cartridge and Post Carbon Filter are not covered in warranty.
I got to know this when my water purifier stopped working a month back and I contacted customer support. Service engineer replaced sediment filter which costed me 550/-. While purchasing water purifier from local market comes with full warranty including internal component.
4) After Sales Service: Service support team is good. No issue in registering service requests and follow ups.

Conclusion: Keep the warranty related stuffs in mind. Other than that everything is okay and good going.",1
"I recently bought the Livpure GLO PRO++, and unfortunately, my experience left much to be desired. In a market where water quality is paramount, the absence of this crucial feature is a significant drawback. Without TDS control, the purifier fails to fulfill its purpose. Overall, I am very disappointed with Livpure GLO PRO++. The ideal TDS for water should be between 50-70, but in this purifier, water TDS is BETWEEN 10-14, which is very harmful. Any purifier that lacks a TDS controller should not be bought. It is the responsibility of manufacturers to make the TDS controller feature mandatory.",0
"Best purifier to buy, we have been used this from 1.5months now. I must say everyone should go for this product without thinking for a minute. Really this product is value for money.",1
"Do not have inbuilt TDS Adjuster, you need to pay extra while installation for this",0
"Initial installation process was smooth no problems for 6months after that filtration went slow because of dust in filter candles service advisor came & solved it later on last before warranty expires i made another service everything was normal. now in 15th month filtration went slow & very late filter process was going, complained & checked by agent he said TDS machine has failed, you need to change this machine then only it will work normally. This is Livpure water purifier utterly dissapointed by item. Almost all RO Water purifiers are working same",0
"The adoptor was found working erratically..intermittent on and off indication of mains power despite being plugged in. There was no manual supplied gor guidance. The Technician wanted a preesure control valve to be inserted between supply pipe and RO inlet owing to high pressureed water in the multistoreyed apartment . There is no guidance for this in the website or any manual(not provided). He wanted to charge 1600 INR for this.
Most importantly as the RO was not working properly owing to defective adopter The technician did not measure/demonstrate the TDS. But surprisingly without my sharing the OTP the installation is being shown as installed satisfactorily.",0
"One of the best budget friendly water purifier. Performance is good and water taste is good.

Pros:
- Budget friendly
- Best in RO segment
- Feature wise good

Cons:
- No pre filter added with the product, need to purchase separately",1
"Do not buy this product,service ver bad and within 17 months pump not working",0
"Installation done well, the guy explained everything,water taste also good.",1
Product quality is really good affordable price with good quality,1
While purification it sounds loud .... Not expected like whatever expectations.,0
"Ya good, but some times sensor issue.",0
Quality is good.I am happy with this product,1
Nice product of low cost budget,1
This really does the job. No taste issue too,1
Best purifier in the budget i got it for 6600 and installation was completed in one day of the delivery,1
The filtration system is excellent brings down TDS level from around 400 to 30-40,1
"I would suggest this water purifier as it is one of budget friendly water filter which will be enough for a family of 3.
Go for it.",1
"Company is cheting by not giving the external filter.
And the service guy charged 1200 rupees for that.
So customers careful while buying. Water teste is also acidic. Not happy with the purchase.",0
RO is OK but need to install TDS controller separately which cost more than 1000 Rs and after installing TDS controller that is also not working properly. TDS is getting decreased continuously.,0
"One of the worst buys in Amazon so far. It’s not Amazon’s mistake but the Livpure installation team which is very poor and pathetic. After receiving the product from Amazon, I got the message from Livpure regarding the installation but the installation person didn’t show up as per the schedule. When I called the technician, he said someone else will visit but no one visited nor called. After 2-3 days of follow up with customer care none of the area coordinator or his boss could solve the issue. When they are ready after getting free after 5 days, they are calling and asking for the installation. Just think if the brand has a support like this and you go for the product with what confidence of support  I made decision to return it instead, we rely of customer service and support not only the brand. Guess what all this has happened in Bengaluru and now consider how the support will be in non metro cities. Please consider these points while buying. Just sharing my worst experience.",0
Water qulity Best Best... Ease to use.. Best desighn,1
Good products I am happy ,1
Pre product for the people looking under a tight budget and the best is the installation person is very friendly.,1
"Sofar this is a good filter. While installing with livpure agent, filter is not included in the box. I have paid 1700 RS (1200 filter and 500 for pressure tube) for filter and pressure tube with free installation. But livpure filter is around 800 rs online. Not sure why they charged 1200 rs during installation.",1
Working as Expected. Thanks to the fast delivery of Amazon installation was done by the company man on the next day. There were no hiccups and I am happy with the purifier. I will write an update after using it for 6 months.,1
Nice product only problem we faced delay in installation .,1
"Reasonably priced and installation was done next day. TDS output coming as 45 for our input water of 225. May need to adjust after some days.
Only issue is with the tap design, it's handle not properly kept, so when fill the water and close it water touches down part of lid and spilling. Kent has simple and upside tap.
Company need to change their tap design, except that everything looks good and taste of water also good after purification",0
Good filter & water taste is good. Service also super. Recommended product,1
Long life working this product. Very nice.. And very taste the water..,1
Go for it! Value for Money!,1
"Product is okay but after sale is very bad.
Recently my RO was serviced by there technician and product was under warranty.
During service, it got cracked by technician and since crack was in middle part of tank and not easily visible. I didnot observed untill it started getting leakage.
Additionally he keeps on asking for buying ACMC for next one year for which i have paid 5500/-

Now getting is repaired is getting costlier as this is not easily available and they are not able to cancel ACMC as well. There service manager won't pick the call as they know if they are getting call, its for complaint only.

So i will suggest to not buy if you don't want to struggle with after sale

Edit 1: Resolving your issue with Customer Care or service Area manager is very tidious. If you want to cancel or need support, they will simply delay the process. I want to cancel ACMC purchased during service and they are not able to cancel. They are just buying time so that once ACMC gets applied to my account, then they will say its already applied.

Edit 2: After following up from last 15 days, now they are saying its applied and call Service manager, but he didnot received the call. Got fooled by them. I will say avoid this product or try not to get another ACMC. Better go with some other product than this",0
I only completed one month and product has been started leakage problem no exchange policy no warranty all the technical visit and ask for money. Getting no support from the company Manufacturing defect.,0
I would like to return this product and apply for refund.,0
Water quality from livepure water purifier is very good. Can feel the difference in water taste from this and the one i am having already. Highly recommended,1
"I began using this product since 2 weeks. It has got leakage issues. At the time of installation I asked the staff whether it's a company product (water filter)? He said yes! And charged 800/-.The water flows frm the white water cylinder. The service guy fixed twice, still it's leaking badly. Very frustrating.water is sprinkling out n spoiling adjacent objects. It makes sounds like exploding with high pressure. This is soo disappointing. When I called the service guy, he told me to register in the app to fix the issue. I couldn't login in to the app. Not responding properly. Return this product after checking right after u get. Don't delay! After following up for weeks the staff has promised to replace with COMPANY WATER FILTER as it was their fault. After fixing the COMPANY WATER FILTER labelled with ""LIVPURE""(original filter) he charged 1000/- again. When asked he was arguing, manipulating and demanding us to pay. So we paid half of the Amt. It's been few days so far their's no issues. PLEASE! DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE STAFF, YOU CHECK YOURSELF & IF NOT SURE ABT ANYTHING RELATED TO THE PRODUCT, DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLL FREE NUMBER. the allotted local staff are fooling customers n earning money in an unfair way! Otherwise the product is working good! Purifier is good so far! No complaints abt the the products.",0
"Best of all I liked the price, it's so much cheaper than other RO filters. The design is sleek. But the only problem I find is that there's no way to see how much water is there inside. I bought it for my mother, and she, being forgetful, often doesn't switch it on and they run out of water. A transparent window to show the level of water would be a great improvement.
Otherwise, so far, for the past few months since I bought it, it's been functioning very well, and the water is pleasant to drink.",1
"Good Test, good look, good service. Love it..",1
"Value for money
Decent water taste
Improved water PH LEVEL
INSTALLATION SERVICE IS GOOD
HOPE IT LASTS LONG …",1
good quality ro but livpure do not provide 1st main candle that has to buy seperately,1
"Delivered product was not working properly since day 1 onwards, I am facing so many issues within short period.

Below i have mentioned the issues:

1. Water is not coming.(At the time we raised ticket on this issue, service person came and fixed it, after 30 min again facing same issue).

2. Mother Board & Sensor light Issue.(After raised another ticket service person visited and he confirmed because of board issue water is not coming, So after 10 days he came with the new board & Sensor light spare parts to fix this issue and replaced with them but again we are facing another issue).

3. Front side indication light board is not working.

Within this 1 month duration we are facing so many struggles with the different kind of issues, my parents are aged and we are fully disappointed using this product, even though my neighbor's also asking to my parents in my apartment, why they are coming frequently due to this issues because they are using water purifier's since long back onwards without any issues.

So, finally I tried to connect Amazon support team, and requested them to replace the product because it's a new product and also facing so many issues within short period, but they won't give replacement and also they suggested me to connect livpure service provider team and ask them to replace the product, as per Amazon support team guidelines, I connected with livepure service provider team and requested replace my product, but they told me we are not providing replacement Amazon only provide you the replacement.

Finally as per my understand, both of them blaming each other when I am connected with them and also wasting my time and effort and also I felt I loss the money.

They are not understanding customer pain, this was not fair at all.

If I am not getting replacement of this product I am planning to complaint consumer complaints portal, and also need to inform all my friends and colleagues don't buy this product through Amazon.",0
"Liked the product.service agent said to purchase one more filter which will be fixed outside for which he would charge 1000/-,but I rejected to do so.",0
"Good product and purifies water well. One thing is that the delivery associate asked to install an extra filter, which we got installed. However, we later realized that the manual and the box both state that no additional filter is required to be installed with the purifier. Hence reducing 1 star in the rating.",1
There is some noise,0
"- At the first glance, You will be disappointed by its looks. It is no where related to what it is shown on product page. This looks cheap China bazar plastic material made out of thrown out plastic buckets. Evenmore cheap is the copper color designs on that body. I am now worried what the plastic quality they might have used for the Plastic water tank inside.

- The rotating round water tap irritates you always because you don't want everytime 2 hands working for a glass of water. No Tray to keep glass.

- Water flow is very slow. Do the dumbbell exercise with the bottle/glass while it fills.

- The noise while it purifies water irritates so much. I had to switch off everytime after filling its tank and turn on when empty. Other wise, every single glass you take out, it irritates with noise.

- The water wastage is same as other purifiers and I don't complain much on that nor even happy about it.

Finally, I wanted to return this product but not possible. Amazon arranged Livpure technician visit to check my complaints. I complained only about Noise and Water Flow. He simply said, ""You might have used other brands before but Livpure has these problems common sir, these are not problems sir. I am visiting many homes and all are saying only this. We cannot do anything sir. It is like that only. Cannot change tap, cannot control noise. It is acceptable as per company"".

Finally could not return and struggling to use it for the last 20",0
We haven't received pre sediment and carbon filter and guarantee card and manual in this package.The installation also late.Thank you.Please send those.,0
"Livepure purifier is good. But after sale service is not good ..They will not properly track and assign service.

Even they call you and ask to rate if you purchase newly this is because of the rating balance....",0
Product quality is very worst after 4 months of uses that it's stopped working and not able to identify the problem and asking me to pay Rs6000.i had very bad experience I will not recommend to go for it. Ok,0
I liked it but no seevice provided by company no filter change timely .it is very bad to say that no free service was givenduring nine months passed,0
Thanks for amazing product and thanks for Amazon team sent to good product really fantastic .water is very tasty and healthy thank you all,1
"Nice product, it has all the nice factors. And the features as mentioned and received are matching, I got satisfaction. The taste of water is very good, and the taste of minerals is also found. Look very nice.",1
"I love the taste of the water, quality is good and the product is cool as per the view.. keep going for this one  you won’t regret it",1
"Best in service, Water Quality .Only faucet little harder ,Sharper or Faucet colour (coper) shiny Ness wanish withing one r two use .",1
"
Product was delivered on time by Amazon and installation done by Livpur person within 2 days.The taste of watervis also very good.Highly recommend.",1
"Installation is hassle free. Water TDS level drop from 1900 to 130. Water Taste is good
Got one day installation service, easy process.",1
Good product ever and easy to use their was no defect at all ....,1
"Installation was quick. Did not face any problem, aesthetically looking good for my house",1
"Product stopped working after 2 days. The product doesn’t work unless you purchase the initial Rs 1100 filter and then the person who came to install is only interested in selling service options. So basically the 13000 you paid is useless unless you pay these guys 5000 more. Even after doing all this, the product stopped working after 2 days and we are chasing the installer and amazon to correct this junk product",0
It's been a year I'm using this everything is good about water filter but the service is worst no one came to do the service I have asked customer care and they too didn't respond it's like a waste of money as the filters need to be replaced but I don't know where to contact as no one is replying .,0
Not a worthy product,0
"Worst Ro filter.Makes alot of banging sound, filtration time is very high and water wastage is also very high.Not recommended this brand under consideration to buy.",0
Please do not ever buy this product,0
It's working as expected. Nice product. Nice built quality as well. Water purification is as expected. Less wastage of water.,1

"The Livpure Bolt Copper+UV+UF Water Purifier is an excellent choice for homes relying on municipal water sources. Its innovative combination of copper infusion, UV sterilization, and UF filtration ensures thorough purification. The copper infusion aids in eliminating harmful contaminants, while the UV sterilization technology neutralizes microorganisms effectively. The UF filtration system removes suspended particles, enhancing the taste and clarity of the water. With its compact design and user-friendly interface, this purifier is a convenient and reliable solution for clean and safe drinking water at home.",1
"The idea of eliminating RO is major enticer. Copper bolt adds value to drinking water.
Simple operation, auto stop at full storage and easy to dispense.
Needs less water pressure than RO purifier.
Means good quality at less operating cost...
Very nice",1
"Leakage and Bad after sales service during installation.
Update: Issue was resolved within a week of installation. New guy was assigned the installation task. Product is now working as expected.
Update 2: Product stopped working after a year due to internal parts getting damaged somehow. The parts that must be replaced are costly. Hence, do not recommend it for people looking for durability, built quality & low maintenance.",0
"Great product, have been using it for 3-4 months and it's working fine",1
Works well. Water tastes good too. But the flow velocity is quite low. It will annoy you if you are filling 3/4 bottles at a time.,0
"Outstanding addition to my kitchen. It's design is sleek and stylish. It's UV+UF ensures pure, clean water and copper enrichment noticably improves the taste. Overall, it's excellent value for money. I highly recommend this top-notch water purifier. Five stars well deserved.",1
"I've been using livepure water purifier earlier also, this new purifier I've got installed at my new apartment. The taste of water dispensed after purification is good and safe. The engineer who came for installation was very good he was very polite.",1
"Service is not good, Purifier is not working few days after installation. We need follow up with customer service and technicians multiple days. Overall Experience to setup take a week or more to working condition.",0
"Con..Just it takes an hour to fill the water tank. I didnt opt for the pre filter because my TDS LEVEL was below 170
Cons after 6months customer service says as it's online purchase the change of sediment and carbon filter is chargeable. If it's a offline purchase it's non chargeable. I don't understand there logic. In both case is written comprehensive one year warranty",0
The product stopped working after 3 months. The service agent said the filter is damaged he fixed a new filter yesterday and today again it is not discharging any water ... Please be aware the filter costs 350 and annually there is cost of 1800 for membrane,0
"Overall good experience with product, having storage capacity is plus point. But with product additional pre-filter suggested by service technician for long life and better performance on purification, suggestion to purchase or include it with main product",1
"1. Sent used product
2. Installation took week time to come
3. Live pure customer care are rude
4. Amazon customer care is helpless
Lost money and also left with used product which is not working at all. Amazon large appliance team services sucks",0
"After 6 month they unable to filter the water and I will lodge the complaint about service they don't know what is the time duration of change the filter. And not any indicator to describe purifier is working or not.
Most important thing is that they have given 2 free service without filter change. They charge for the filter replacement so guys please don't buy this.
Worst product",0
"The machine stopped working right after 2 months and the issue is not addressed by the company.
Delayed resolution of the same.
However, resoleved.",0
"Suitable for low TDS level water as it does contains RO. Still works fine
Writing after 9 months after purchase RO works well but no any free service given by company whereas rate is very high. Tap does not fixed properly which slips repeatedly which is a very bad modification I don't like",0
"Good experience with the overall process starting from delivery by Amazon to installation and post sales service.

Good water filter , without ro and without wastage.",1
Easy installation and easy to use not have any idea about maintainence cost in future,1
If your drinking water is naturally good then buy this because you want copper drinking water… if not then don't buy this because it has no RO.,0
"This is an awesome product to buy if you are a family of 3-4 people. Storage capacity is good.

One thing that I'm a bit disappointed with is it's filtration speed. Once I observed, it took about 30 mins to fill 7 litres of tank. It might be due to low water pressure at that time. But still I feel, with good water pressure also, it's filtration speed is less than what's mentioned in product details.",1
Water purifier is not upto the expectation and found nonfunctional several times since its installation. I will complaint through email.,0
"Still today i am facing the same issue of sensor problem. Product is not in working condition at present also. I have submitted just now pic as an attachment. It is keep on failing from the date of purchase i.e, from 13th oct 2023. I wll strongly suggest to not to buy it from amazon..and even u should check this once with livpure outlets also before buying..",0
This purifiers water level is not suitable in my area.,0
"Update: After 1 year of usage writing this to let you all know that do not buy any Livpure product, their after sales service is very very very very poor. I bought their annula maintainence contract for 3 years and since then they haven't provide service to the unit. The service request was raised on March and now it's May, no one cares at all.. Their customer care call center is absolutely bogus... Just kept you waiting for more than an hour. No one replies to email as well. Your request is in just limbo and it is absolutely waste of money, time amd energy. Please don't buy.

Update : I was contacted by Livpure team wherein they explained regarding storage tank and noted the suggestion for future. I appreciate their after sales service efforts for customer satisfaction, in case of any further issues they even assured their support.

I took 1 star as storage is not exactly 7lts....it's 6.25 or something.
Apart from that it's just awesome, installation was hassle free and every detail was explained well. Water tastes nice and soft.
It takes 27 to 30 mins to purify water which also good because this time is essential for entire process.
Overall it's great and you can go for it.

P.S. RO is not essential if you receive municipal water so please avoid buying it.",0
The stirage capacity is sufficient also the water is well purified installation was very easy,1
"I really loved the product, The purification of water is too clean and the taste of water is also as like bisleri water.
100% worth purchasing.",1
"Product works really well and it's easy to install, plus service of Livpure is really great they call and check from time to time and if there is any problem it gets resolved within 24 hours",1
Installation took little time but the product is excellent. The company has high standards you can feel when product is installed. 100% go ahead.,1
"It's a very good water purifier. Its works great for tds upto 200. Water tastes good. Installation if free of cost.
Please note it does not come with pre filter sediment.",1
"It's easy to manage and operate. Look wise, it appears quite good. Clean water is a priority for good health and fitness. The water looks clean and feels pure in terms of taste.",1
"buy it, if you are not so particular about Bisleri taste( Don't know what RO level they are at). Overall i will say it is a good product, reasonable taste..Customer service is great amazing. Overall 4 star",1
"The taste of water is good, very prompt installation service from livpure and also the filter is working fine as expected in the initial month use.",1
"Nice product and service from livpure.
Post delivery installation was done very next day and till now it's all going well.
Thanks Team",1
"Product is very good quality
Service is very good and fast
Price very very reasonable
Thanks live pure for quality Product and service",1
"The installation was smooth. The technician had good knowledge of the product and did a good.

The product is working well since installation. I am happy",1
A lot of scratches on the product see images,0
Bad brand service,0
"Never buy this product from amazon. First of all it came without warranty card and the item was defective. You have to call the livpure service 100 times after that they will pick the call. Livpure has the worst customer care and worst service technician. They don't even know the basic things. They have installed the defective item and water is leaking. I have been calling them since last 3 days and the only response you will get is please allow 24 to 48 hours. Their 24 to 48 hours never passes. Please never buy this product.
I am going to return this product and will never purchase anything from livpure again.",0
"Purifier does not leak, build quality is fine, since it's UV only cannot measure ppm change or filtering quickly. Pre filter is additional if required you can buy from installation person.",1
"It's been a year of usage after which I'm writing a review. Purifier works fine, installation wasn't that great. Till now there's a part that needs to be attached that hasn't been provided which is leading to water dripping.
Coming towards taste just keep in mind there is no change in water as such .So, it can be good or bad depending upon the taste but after-sales service is worst literally an engineer visits after 10-15 days after raising a complaint.",0
Like product and referral to my friends as well,1
"I feel it's a value for money product at this price range.

Pros:
Adequate storage capacity
No waste water
No problems after months of use
Good customer support

Cons:
Does not improve bore well water taste. If TDS is above 150, it might be better to go for RO.",1
"Livpure Glitz is a quite good water purifier. I chose this after watching some Youtube reviews. As my water supply is quite clean I had no need of RO system. I just wanted UV and Filtration. This product quite fitted in that area.
It has around 7 litres of capacity which is good for home purposes. But the flow is very slow. It takes around half an hour for filling up fully. Not a big problem but worth mentioning.
After a few days of use, my wife still complained about a Plastic Smell from the water. According to her, the smell remained for quite a long time though I couldn’t find any such smell after 2 days. May be she has higher smell sense and I’m dumb.
But after a few months, I tricked her by giving water from Purifier and she couldn’t smell anything. So may be it was psychological for her, I dont know.
Apart from this Plastic Smell for a longer period, I had no other complaints.
The service is also quite good and widespread in the country.",1
"I am writing to express some concerns regarding the recent installation performed at our premises.
Moreover, we have observed discrepancies in the water quality following the installation. The raw water TDS level was below 100 before installation, but post-installation and purification, it has increased to 128. This raises doubts about whether the installation was carried out properly.
We would appreciate it if you could investigate these issues and provide a prompt resolution.
Looking forward to your prompt response.",0
"Installation was free yet I have to paid INR1100
This should be made clear to customer in advance.",0
"I have used 2 aqua guards in last 20 years and was very satisfied. But now it was time to try out something different. With the high quality corporation water supply with TDS of around 150ppm, I just needed a UV+UF storage filter with a capacity of around 5-10 litres. Livpure Glitz DX seemed just the right product for the purpose with 7 litres of storage, automatic top-up after 2 litre depletion, gravity based water dispensation without power. Storage compartment is well protected from external ingress of dust, tiny flies and the likes. And the external body of the unit is easy to clean - just wipe with dry cloth or lightly hoisted shammy.

An external sedimentation filter included in the price would have earned a 5 star on the 'Value for money' rating. In summer months Indian families use 'matka a' or earthen pots for drinking water. A tap with a T joint to pipe into the earthen pot would be a game changer as currently we find ourselves filling bottles from Glitz and transferring into the 'matkaa'

In 1 year, if the tap hasn't broken down/leaked and the product performs as good as it has after a month, I would be happy to raise the rating from 4 to 5 star.",1
"Initially it took some to switch the taste from a RO water filter to this ..as we are having now municipal water , there is no point in using RO water filter , and overall ,it's a good product ... Taste of water is good ,service is good ..",1
"The water supply at my place has TDS in the range of ~120 to ~250. Based on the WHO's permissible limit of ~300 PPM, I got my RO unit replaced by this UV+UF unit.

The water taste is obviously different as the TDS of filtered water is now same as supply water. The tap flow is much faster as compared to our older RO unit. Refilling is also quite fast.

Hope it is not too late for our bodies to adjust accordingly.",1
Customer service is pathetic. Filter does not even last a month. Warranty covers service professional visit only. None of the parts are included in warranty. DONT BUY LIVPURE.,0
"Good water purifier with economical price. Tank capacity is sufficient and also have led indicator for tank water label.
Only thing which I don't like is external filter rate which is 800. I found it costly. It's available in 300 RS in the market.",1
"Technical aspects: If you get supply of corporation water then RO is useless.
Is been 3 months i have been using this product . Quality is same as my last candle filter though i have not checked with TDS meter.
Installation guy tries to sell external filter. please do not buy that filter. Its non branded and they just want to sell.
No value addition in terms of filtration capability of the same .
Suggestion to the company and service guy to inform and know at least the micron size of the different filters and educate the customers for better trust in the product.
There are internal three stages of filtration which suppose to be enough for the pure drinking water + Infrared. Not aware whether infrared works or not.
Most important - When you get warm water it means the filter got clogged and you need to clean it. Cleaning is very simple by the process of reverse flushing of the primary filter. No need to call the service personnel as they charge extra for such visits.
will update the review after a year of usage.",1
Best Water Purification ever.... Installation done Properly...,1
It's been 06 days and the installation package was automatically cancelled by livpure. Amazon customer care couldn't do anything about it. Think twice before you order livpure.,0
"Last week i purchased this livpure product from amazon, and next day its stopped working. I raised the complaint and its been more than 4 days but no technicaian visit happened after muliple followups with call center, pathetic service and bad quality product. I am regretting on my decision to go with livpure.",0
Worst don't buy,0
"Water leakage, missing parts, worst customer service.",0
"Livepure has one of the worst after sales customer support one can ever have, i literally had to call there support team multiple times for getting it installed where tgey just lied for 4 days stating tecnician will come today you will get a call in 2 hours but niether i use to get calls nor the tecnician came you will have to wait 10 15 mins to get conneted to there call, post tgat also you will not get satisfactory resolution they promised it will installed in 24-48 hrs but it took 100s of calls and more than 4 days to get it installed this is the situation of there service in tier 1 city. Livepure needs to improve there after sales services, the product might be good but there services i experienced is the worst.",0
"We purchased Livpure water filter 4 months back and it started overflowing after 15 days and till we registered 5 complaints for same but still problem persists.
There service attend time is minimum 20 days sec very unprofessional services executives.",0
"Purchased this purifier and got delivered on time. Installation surprisingly happened on the same day.
1. Water taste is amazing. You will love it.
2. Low cost of maintenance.
3. Multi layer water purification.
4. Built quality is Okay.",1
"Yes, it’s a pleasure using this product. Value for money product having bunch of features like quality, warranty and specially purity. Good in appearance, colour and ease of installation.",1
Value for money. Definitely go for it! Highly recommended.,1
"I have received the product with damage. I'm not sure if this happened in transit or it was there way before. However the technician replaced the part that got damaged.
But the product is great. Filtration is excellent.",0
"The product was having leakage issue since its installation and I was not getting and proper resolution from the service team.

However, Sushmita ma'am from livepure helped me out with my complaint and connected me with right service technician (Mr. Anil) to resolve the issue. Now the product is working fine",0
"We are giving this products review after using it for 2 weeks
Installation was good 
TDS checking is must important priorly
After installation
First use of 7 litres capacity should be discarded.
We tested TDS before drinking
TDS of drinking water should be under 100
First you should check how much TDS is your water which you use daily
Because it can affect body and health in some sort of time
After first use, our TDS of livpure was 95
Then it dropped down to 92
Water is so much pure
We felt purity and cleaniness in water

The installation guy will tell you to use pre -filter
But if your TDS is more than 500 , you should install pre -filter with livpure

Service is best  providing 2.5 years warranty

For now Livpure is the best water purifying you can have for family

Just buy and have a happy healthy life
",1
"Product having basic features with 2.5 yrs maintenance free...copper, RO, UV....etc. water will be purified to Max and liked this. But donot have advanced features like Bluetooth and app support to check the consumption, health conditions.

The tap Design is having a flaw, water will be spilled when we lift tap upwards. So not worth for the money , we have many more brands and better for the money.",0
"Product was good in overall. Storage was also big as required.
But it was returned due to locking issue of cabinet.",1
Overall good product and best service staff.,1
The water test is very good. And 2.5 years no maintenance cost this is totally amazing.,1
"Worst quality no installation after 5 days of delivery,even installation person tell over the phone for extra charges,very bad service from livepure.",0
"Easy installation, completely satisfactory product.",1
I like this product of Allura prima about good taste and low waste of water and no extra filters required and free installation and maintenance free on all services and filters for 30 months i searched 1week in Amazon all companies and all purifiers after that I will be decided to purchase allura prima it's a best deal for everyone Just go for it thank you,1
"Product was delivered within time and without any damage. Installation service was quick.
Using the purifier from one month. Taste is good and no problems.",1
Not a worthy product and no proper response from service engineers and from customer care too -100 out of 10,0
"I would have given less then 1* but don't have an option here.
After purchasing this just 15days after it started giving problems.
No UV purification is there so water is not pure. Water tank is looked like made of reusable plastic. Nowhere looked food grade plastic.
Technician told using some antiscalant filter which is chemical. When googled found this is chemical which is only used to enhance membrane life and not good for health.",0
"Product arrived in time. But the installation took more than 10 days. I had to request, plead and beg with the company for installation. Worst. Don't buy LivPure simply because of poor service. I am worried whether they will attend to any complaints. The so called 30 months warranty is totally unreliable.",0
"Good and service need to be improve.
Which is good product.
With more experience I can provide the feedback on this",1
"The best water purifier in the country with 10 stages of purification plus freedom from maintainence for 30 months.
Will definately refer to my friends and colleagues in the city",1
This Purifier looks great after installation. 30 months free service should prevent me from all the post-purchase hassles. Let's see how it goes.,1
"Livpure Allura a very good product,nice service good company , fiture by good long time use low maintenance nice Product",1
Horrible product. The warranty is very board but does not cover anything. Does not cover part replacement or filters. Product is made of bad plastic that smells. I had diarrhea after drinking this DO NOT BUY!!!,1
this product is not well...tds 122 water tast is not good...other options is best in market...plz improve the quality....price is very high according this product,0
"This is the worst product which I have received. The moment we got it installed we told the technician to maintain the TDS level to 150 , but in a few days it shot up to 450 , then again we called the technician to again adjust it to 150 but now it went down to 20.
We have called a technician 3 times within a month but we are not getting the required Water quality.
I suggest not to buy this product.",0
"The features of Product is quite impressive when i was ordered it. and installation was completed by LIVPURE on next day after received.
but i faced issue since first day that even this product having Mineraliser water taste is very bitter. And thrown lot's of waste water when my input tap water have normal 300-350 tds.
after contact FLIPKART the first day after installation for replacement, they delayed my issue every time and given new dates for resolution till my Replacement policy. and after my replacement policy they said that your policy period is over while i raised my issue very early wasn't resolved.
i disappointed from FLIPKART for their delaying my unresolved issue and denied for replacement.
very poor experience in after sale response by FLIPKART to the their PLUS Member.",0
"There's a leakage issue in water purifier. Water keeps on dripping. Also if we turn off the filter water still enters filter.
The leakage complaint has been filed 3 times still the issue is not resolved. Earlier the service engineer told its a loose installation issue and he fixed the issue and went, but once the purifier got filled, water started leaking again. During subsequent visit he tried to do same to fix issue and during his 3rd visit he told its a water filter issue and some of its part needs to be replaced. Seriously are you sure flipkart that the seller sent me a non detective product. Since day of installation almost a week i haven't been able to use it at all due to this leaking issue and now they say its a defect in product. Highly unsatisfied with this product and Livpure service and wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it.",0
"Product is good but service from livpure is the worst in the world. I bought it on May 2, 2017 and my service is due since 1 month. I have received message for service scheduled multiple time and got the happy code as well as engineer detail but no one has come for service yet. Don't buy livpure as they just want to sell their product but don't care about the service.",0
The Mosttttttttttttttt..... horribleeeeeeeeeeeee....... service from livepure..... they always wanted loot the money once the warranty of the purifier is expired the moment my purifier warranty got over they started forcing me to take the AMC by paying around 5500/- per year for the machine which will cost us around 8000/- that is almost 70% of the value of the actual machine. When you don't agree for that within few days they will ask us to change the filters with the cost of 1000/- + 350/- service charge and while changing the filter stupid unprofessional engineer damaged my machine I think within 3 days of Channing the filters my purifier stoped filtering the water and then the moment you log the complaint again they will ask you to pay 350/- service charge again to check the issue and then they will ask us to replace some coil on the purifier which will cost around 2500/- then you imagine what kind of third rated company livepure is... I will never ever suggest anyone to buy this stupid company purifiers they will make you sick once you buy the purifier they never ever bothered about the customer satisfaction..... Never ever buy this company purifiers...,0
"Stopped work in 5 months. its having In warranty maintenance service is too late, still no response from the engineer, bad experience with engineer. . because of its free maintenance if it is chargeable they may respond quickly.
worst experience .... 15 days got over still no action from the company... they are saying due to lockdown, but morning 6 to 10 am is no lock down.
waste of money",0
"Very bad product, RO membrane damaged within 20 days only which is not covered under warranty , please don't buy it. Loss of Money and time for service request only",0
"There is no TDS adjuster in this product, and TDS is coming ~27,
Worst product to buy from flipkart, sometimes water is coming like detergent.

Without installation only flipkart guys marked as installation done.",0
"Poor quality product. Stopped working twice in a month. On the very next day after installation, there was a leakage near tap. Got repaired somehow. Now after a month entire device stopped working. Done a mistake choosing this product over Eureka Forbes or PureIt",0
"Bought this in Big Billion Day sale at Rs. 6649. I think this is super worthy & probably the best purifier out there in market under 10K. Just keep in below points-
1) Firstly check the TDS level of ur supply water; if it is above 300, then only go for an RO purifier. Otherwise u absolutely don't need to spend on this.
2) Call Livpure Customer care & check if the service is available in ur area or not. I live in a remote village of WB, and still they get this installed pretty fast.
3) MOST IMPORTANT- There is a option of pre-TDS level setting in this purifier. The installation technician will do this at the last part of installation. Make sure u tell him/her to keep the settings at 100-120 level. This process takes time, so they tend to skip this. Make them bound to do that.
4) Don't fall into trap of AMC, because unless u have a pretty high tds of supply water, u don't need to change the RO cartridge before 3 years. And an external pre-filter costing rs 700 will do the job of keeping the health of inner filter for long period of time.

That's all. YOU CAN BLINDLY GO FOR THIS PRODUCT.",1
"Good.. delivered and installed on same day.. very good quality .. no other product at this price point with RO+UV+UF+Taste enhancers..

Aesthetically very good design.. looks good better than expensive product from other companies...

Edited:
Just for everyones information, all the water purifiers are same in terms of components. The actual matters is the purification steps in the product.
Only RO water is not good for health as it removes all essential minerals necessary for body. Thats why most RO comes along with UF which actually mix some amount UF water to RO water to enrich with minerals (It just mixes the water before RO cartridge with RO permeate).
UV (Its a Ultraviolet light with specific frequency used to kill microbes): it is not necessary (if you have RO) as the function of it's to kill microbes in the water but anyhow microbes will not pass by RO membranes. Residues can be killed by UV.
Taste enhancer cartridges are functions the same as UF and differs a little bit as the cartridge itself consist of minerals with controlled quantity irrespective of water available at different locations. It adds the mineral in particular quality to match the taste to natural drinking water.",1
"The product is very good, The best part is it has a TDS adjustment function. I searched on the Internet a lot but found this is the best purifier with respect to cost and having all required functionality. I have a municipality water connection which TDS is around 260-300 which is considered good but as municipality water is surface water (From river and Pond) it has some micro germs which increase especially in the rainy season. The UV function of the purifier assures to have safe water from all germs.

I have set TDS of water between 130-150 as drinking very low TDS water test better but it is very dangerous for health in long term. The setting can be done by the customer but required a TDS meter and little care.

The time taken to fill a 7-liter tank is around 15-20 minutes, the waste water we collect and bucket and use for gardening purpose. In the summer if you have a family of 5 people you may be required to on this two times in a day for the rest of the time you can switch off the power button.",1
"Good RO+UV+UF at this price. I got it for 8500. I have purchased prefilter (800 rs) from livpure while installing.

Inlet bore well water: 990ppm
Outlet from Livpure : 30ppm

Water Quality: 5
Build Quality: 4
Value for money: 5
Installation: 5

If you are looking for good RO+UV+UF at less than 10k go for it without second thought.",1
It is really a great product. At this low cost you will not get and water purifier having RO + UV + UF. it has also a decent water storage capacity of 7 liter. it is good for small family or even medium size family. I am using it at my home since last 3 months and it is working really fine. I will suggest you guys to go for it. I bought it in a deal at price around Rs. 7700/-,1
"TDS level post purification hovers in the range of 50-100. There's some noise during purification but nothing out of place. It has RO+UV+UF+ Mineraliser. The Mineraliser is most probably a gimmick. If TDS level post purification stays between 50-150, you're good to go. Kindly do not buy water purifiers which reduce the TDS levels below 50. Tank capacity is good. Takes 15-20 minutes to top the tank. Water taste is almost at par with Bisleri. The tap is a bit of nuisance. If you're not careful while shutting it off, it may spray some water in sides due to ridiculous design. You must have seen this type of tap in water dispensers. They should've gone with normal tap design. It has 3 symbolic lights, one is for power, one is for purification process indication and third one goes live when tank is full. No other information is provided by this water purifier. It comes with a sleek adaptor. The adaptor cable looks a bit flimsy but that's okay as you don't have to pull that out everyday. The installation was done very next day. Installation person was very polite and skilled. It took merely 30 minutes to clean and install the purifier. Overall build quality is good. Water taste and odour is also good. At this price point it is totally value for money. It would be a steal if you can get it in some offer at or around 8K-9K.",1
"Writing this review after 45 days of usage.

First of all its difficult to find a purifier with RO + UV + UF at this price point, that too from a reliable brand. The water tastes sweet after purification which is really good. As usual quick delivery by Flipkart, good installation support by the brand as well.

Overall its a great product and worth every penny spent!",1
I am happy with product and quality of water is awesome but only bad thing is installation process where technician charged 700rs for pre filter installation but it is not worth. Even same I raised complaints for livepure but till now nothing is heared.,1
"Adding review after item usage
Proper service is not there for Hyderabad Miyyapur people
If you raise the ticket for service its sala is 2 to 3 days but it was fixed after 30 days for me...

ONLY ONE SUGGESTION IS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT PATCH ABOVE THE WATER DISPENSER (OUTLET) TO INDICATE THE WATER LEVEL.",1

Overall good experience.",1
"I got it for 8400 with one day delivery. Flipkart delivery was amazing. We use the borewell water for drinking and the TDS was very high around 1000!!!

After many searches and going by the reviews online I settled for LivPure and I must say that its a great purifier. Now the TDS is around 60 to 80 with RO filter. It has a taste enhancer also so you wont feel water tasteless.

It has tank full indicator and auto off facility as well. Its been 15 days now everything is OK with product.

I would say GO FOR IT its the only purifier available in less than 10k with RO+UV+UF all 3.",1

Awesome service flipkart..The rate @which I got this machine is way less than in market, in market its 13k plus, I got it in 6900 during big billion sale.. Water taste is great on first day..Wll update later after using ut for few days..",1
After so much of confusion with positive and negative reviews.....I decide to try this model .....as it is budget friendly....but after seeing the performance of purifier.....I had a heartful of satisfaction......good performance@ reasonable price..but one thing u must be cared about the service centre..... before buying it ....once check is there any Livpure service centre near you...... Luckily I had a service centre in my area.....and the agent was dedicated and friendly too,1
Worst product ..after being installed almost 3 times purifier stopped working and had to contact customer support .. bad filters always problem,0
"Livepure doesn't value it's consumers and the guy who comes for installation is asking to call plumber for tap water connection, i really had a very bad experience also the installation guy doesn't installed the ro in a proper way, I will not recommend to buy this product",0
"It wasn't installed properly as a result, it started leaking water. Furthermore, you have to buy an additional filter for it to work efficiently.",0
"The product is good but they do not give services, not a single time. I have tried so many times and complained also, but they do not respond. Finally I have done services from outside.

I'm not recommended by his services.",0
After installation the engineer said that For servicing it will cost me 4800...I was shocked after hearing this.. then I regret for buying this ro...I got it for 7500....and after hearing the maintaince cost .....I was shocked ... Company should think about seevicing,0
product good installations also completed nice installations i have taken 2 for parents and for me it's work great,1
"Best RO water filter you can have for your home. It contains all required steps in water filtration.

I recommend to go for it without giving a second thought. Superb design, low water wastage, water indicator, value for money are it's USP.

Thanks to flipkart for delivering on time and with proper packaging.",1
"This is our 2nd unit. We first purchased in 2016, it had a life of 5 years and exactly after 5 yrs, we took this one. This is just awesome.. value for money.. water smells, tastes like Bisleri.. just believe me, you won't regret...
Let's give health n happiness to our families by buying this Livpure water purifier.. Like if you find this review useful",1
"Nice water purifier. All functions RO, UV, UF are working fine. Nice installation services. For installation you need not to call customer service. Livpure will arrange installation automatically by sending you SMS. Customer service by Livpure also very good.

"Best product, so many people commented that there is no installation after product delivered, if you think that after so long time installations not done, you can also register a request of installation to livpure official website directly in which you have to fill all the details and they'll contact you through call.",1
"This is not a review of this product. This is about after sale support from livpure. I have been waiting for the engineer for past 4 days. Everyday I will get a call that engineer will come and do the installation.
Installation deadline was given as 8th May and that too over now. If this is the service given for installation in a Metro City, you can imagine the service in tier 2 & 3 cities.
Now also I called engineer and he is telling lame excuses that he came to my area but missed my address. Again he is asking to text my address.
Really unhappy with the support by Livpure.
If he misses another day I would like to return the product.

Edit**
Installation done. Taste of the water is good. Only 14 litres of water is wasted per full tank.",1
"Great product. No issues since 6 months. Initially there is lil leakage in tap but that stops after 1 month ...u can call call center and fix that though ..great value for money.

1 advise before installation take external filter from outside so u can save lil money like 200 rs extra ...by the way installation ppl not forcing it to install totally ur choice. Installation guys are great . I am happy less maintenance per year then other popular brand.",1
Don't go be reviews... No TDS control in machine which is not mentioned anywhere... Worst experience ever,0
Worst product and this idiot Flipkart is not helping also even it's in return window,0
"You will regret if purchase!!
I bought this purifier in May 2023 . Placed a service request on sep2023 .They have not visited yet for service. I'm doing service with a local RO company. Frequent problem and noise in livpure products",0
"After exactly one year after using purifier,it got repaired water got blocked. But for technical repair cost is very high",0
"Dont fall into their trap. Their after sell service is just pathetic. Despite placing several request for service, no one came to do the job. they did not even bother to contact me. Perhaps the worst company i have ever dealt with. Its my humble request please dont buy their products. I dont want anyone to suffer like me.",0
Tap design is not good as after releasing the tap while closing water will spill all over the surface,0
Don't buy this product.. worst service from Livpure. I have raised service request on 13th but till now I haven't received any calls for service... You will not get proper response,0
"100% Original & Best quality product received, I'm putting this review after a use of 3 months, not facing any problems.
Installation was very smooth, feedback & service from LivPure is excellent and very quick.
2 extra filters you need to buy for Rs. 1500, only if you wish to (when you have too much hard water).
Easy to use, no frequently maintenance required.
2 free extra service check-up provided by LivPure just to make sure product is running at his best without any problems.
Good control on TDS & Water taste is also good after purifying.",1
"I am using it from last 6 month and the result is very good so my decision was right to purchase it , company installation was on same day of purchase , it's working very silent and enhance water test on odur from water ,storage capacity is sufficient for small family , overall it's good product in this range and value for money you can go for it.",1
"Nice product, really good but installation person will charge for small alterations or I already had a pre-filter housing he was forcing me to by the new one, where I told him no need to change the housing and only changed the paper candle. Even he was forcing me to change the inlet wall which was in good condition...need to handle them carefully.",1
"if your purpose is to get pure and purified water then you can get this..
other expensive RO purifier does the same with difference in capacity of water and their extra dramatic feature like LED lights, digital buttons, hot water but with a huge price of 20-25K.
so if your only wish is to get good water go for it without wasting your money on expensive RO",1
"2days back I received this product, so won't comment in details on performance right now... It has RO+UV+UF+TE and with a price tag of 8999, it is the best available water purifier in the market. Water tastes very good, credit goes to the taste enhancer technology. Tap water has 350 ppm TDS, after purification, it came down to 50-60... It has approx 7 litres storage capacity as mentioned. Everything is as expected so far... Will again review after 3 or 6 months of usage... Quick delivery by flipkart... Installation done on the next day only... I recommend you to go with this one, won't regret...",1
"Warranty card missing in the box. Installation was very poor, no details given for delivery boy. Prefilter also not fixed even we are ready to paying extra money. Very bad experience. Once we started to use water from the purifier full family suffers throat inspection.",0
"Worst product, i recently purchased this product after 1 month I am facing water leaking issue.technican also not worked properly.",0
"Don't buy disturbing 2nd time within eight months when talked with livpure customer care they said there is one year warranty only in which service charge four hundred is free parts charges is applicable...
So don't buy",0
"The filter looks good. Installation was done hassle-free by the liv pure technician. The water tastes good and decent enough.

The only major drawback that I experienced is that it wastes a lot of water during the filtering process. There is an outlet pipe that is used to discharge the waste of unfiltered water.

A 25-liter water can when placed underneath that discharge pipe, it got filled within 20 minutes, to filter 2-3 liters of drinking water. That sums up to approximately a 1:10 ratio of water waste which is not a good water management technology.",0
"Don't buy this product in any circumstances....

I'm writing this after using this product after 20 days

In starting purified water is of good taste, sweet like sugar is mixed but after few days almost 10-15 days it's sweetness will getting vanished and after 20-25 days purified water is totally waste, it's taste is almost like unpurified water .

It's a scam from #Livpure, purifier will be new and shining but i think they changed the KIT, means it's new from outside but fake from internal . They will not give warrantee for a single day on KIT, warranty is only for electric parts .
And the reason behind not giving warrantee on KIT is that the KIT is #Counterfeit and they won't work within a month then how will the give warrantee on KIT .

So the conclusion is don't buy this product, it's a fake product.

My money is wasted on this product .",0
"The installation is smooth...the taste is perfect. I have set the TDS to 200 which is recommended.
Although the water wastage is kind of high.... around 15-20 liter of waste waste each time you full your tank from empty. So, I recommend to use that water for other household purpose.

Anyway build can be improved in this filter as the tap is kind of loose. Overall it's value for money",1
"Nice purifier. In my complex, we are having bore well water, but this purifier done excellent job. Water taste great.",1
Writing this review after first service visit by the technician. It is a simple and compact at first water was a bit hard but after few setting updates problem was resolved. I must suggest people looking for affordable water purifier this is perfect.,1
"I am writing this review after using this product for more then 6 months. Smooth functioning till now. Accessories: Got product with needle valve - tap connector(connected to water supply pipe directly, on other side tap can be provided), Two pipes with enough length for connection, elbow type connectors(2nos.)(for prefilter) and power supply adapter. Requirment: You need to purchase prefilter by yourself. Installation person was good at his work. Important: Product has TDS adjustment facility. Installation person adjusted TDS at around 550 ppm. (On request)( He had TDS meter with him). Ratio: 1 bucket of waste water(around 16 lts) is collected on doing single time water storage full. Feature: -More filtration steps along with UV chamber(I personally prefer UV chamber than UV in tank due to intensity difference)- Automatic cutoff when water level reaches to high in tank, indication is also there for full water tank - Easy for Self handling and maintenance - Silent functioning -Decent design -High pressure(drop) alarm (Good for condition checkup) Opinion: Enough water storage for 4 person family. Waste water may be used for mopping and utensils cleaning.",1
"product is good with reasonable price.
works good after installation done yesterday.
delivery bit late but ok with quick installation.",1
Water taste is not good and reliable. It's like as Raw water,0
Always giving trouble. Stopps working once in every month. They have not replaced also.,0
Very bad product...i used from last 1 week and its rejection water is blocked....and TDS is more then 500 .... Memrain also working stop within 1 week..,0
"Worst survice by Liv pure and Flipkart also
Recommended not to buy",0
"Don't buy this product, TDS not controlled, 5 times service persons came and worked but problem not solved and product not replaced, I called to local service engineer he said product not replace and said that do whatever you do",0
More water is coming out of the filter than the amount of water being stored.,0
Awesome product ! I am unable to find any language to review this product ! The installation by Livpure is too good. Thanks Flipkart !!,1
Awsm product at this price mind blowing purchase 5 star +++++++,1
I got this product on rs 9299 and 10%instant discount on my hdfc debit card so I bought this on rs8369 it's very affordable price and taste of water is very good when I drink water make me feel good bcoz it makes water light weight also.,1
I bought it for 9999 and must say one of the best water purifier in this range. One of the best part i liked is that you dont have to switch on and off the power supply everytime you use it Plus the water tastes pretty good.,1
"Great follow up from the company and the rep. I purchased this product for a new flat which I was moving into at a later date. These guys kept following up with me to know when I was moving and promptly delivered the product. 5 stars there.

The product is so far so good. The installation person had a TDS meter as well and showed me the before and after difference. Did not force me to buy the prefilter and in fact suggested going in for one when the free service is done after a couple of months.

I am loving it so far. Thanks Livpure team.",1
Very good purifier. Water taste is very good. I was first hesitating that should i go for Livpure or should i buy pureit ro+uv but that was only 5 ltrs storage. I bought this at 8100. Very nice deal. But on the other hand installation process was very pathetic. The man who had came for installation was trying to sell booster pump forcefully. He was saying that product will not work. But booster pump is already there in purifier. It doesn't require booster pump. They said it will cost around 2870 for booster pump. So see this type of people they are professionally money robber.,1
"Water taste worst, installation service also worst, return policy not accepted to this product, waste of money, don't buy this product.",0
The installation was very poor..it started leaking after 15 mins of run time.,0
"Dispenser tap broken within 5 months of purchase
And even after raising service request no any service person visited.
Trying number of calls but no positive response.
Dont buy Livepure brand purifier, bad experience.",0
"This product is not original it's a used one.. adapter looks like older and while delivering the product there is no Flipkart seal or label..it came from livepure directly

I am not satisfied with this product",0
when ever I start the purifier. It will make lot of noise while running. even I tried with service requests they will come and open one pipe and re connect it. after one day it will start making sound.,0
"Been a week since I've been using this purifier now. Found it good. Water tastes really good. Came with first year check ups and service vouchers worth INR 1850 free. No issues with the installation also. Do make sure you check with the customer care if they still support installation and service. The installation guy did mention that sometime back there was a mention about Not servicing and installing purifiers bought online. As of now, they still supported when I called up the customer care. Good value for money product.",1
"As always flipkart delivery is superb,,,bought this product during festive offer at 8280...while buying i looked on the reviews about installation which tells they will charge for it...but when i contacted livpure they explained that the policy has been withdrawn & now you can buy it from any e retailer, we will provide full installation and one year complete warranty...installation support was fabulous ...even they chase me for installation...i have recommended this to two of my colleges also & they are happy...:)",1
Its really cool product. I have given it 5 star rating specially for the taste of water. I paid 7k for it during offer period and its totally worth it. The service part was a also good as the installation guy came up the next day on my request. The only thing that looks shady is that he charged Rs. 650 for the external filter and that too without any bill. But overall it is a good option for a low cost water purifier.,1
"An excellent purifier and with excellent service. not sure abt the annual maintenance but that is also economical. great taste of water and highly advisable for a family with max 5-6 members. only prob with the after service is, any replacement even in warranty will cost you, the service charge is the one which is free under warranty.",1
"nice product received inn 2 days got installed very next day nothing needs to be done for installing, automatically Flipkart will do the same with livpuire. overall good product water tastes better then some ro. installed without any charges n done in one hour by technician",1
"Worst quality of product, I purchased this RO after getting my old RO water tests due to Micro + , some one told me that this the best quality of RO and my issued will be resolved after installation of lievpur RO but my issue have not been resolved and my money wasted. If someone purchased it for microbial control plz avoid it",0
"I used 11 months, Don't buy this product because purifier is not purifying TDS 5 ppm and PH 10.5. They are not providing service from 1month and I am daily following but till they are not responding. I suffered lot of health issues . I removed and installed new brand kent.. waste of money this product",0
"It's tooo worst product and brand service is toooooo worst ZERO RATEING
DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT
I AM NOT Using Total 24 hours
Product failure
And who's drinking this purit water in my home all are suffering",0
Livpure is worst  products i ever seen. All the time its membrane got chocked. I am using two livpure products and both show me the same issue. Where membrane got chocked and u need to buy AMC for it. Either it company strategy or they have bad spare parts. If membrane are getting chocked in month as i buyed this in june then i am not sure if i am dring healthy water. In my area tds is around 500. In this low tds if membrane are getting chocked then what will happen when tds is 1000. Better to go with kent ro.,0
"After 07 Days results, continue 03 hrs running than 07 litters water purified.",0
"Completely satisfied with the product.

After lot of research i have decided to go with Livpure even though there were lot of other brands.
In my area bore water tds level is 400-500 , so I went with this model.
The delivery and installation from Flipkart has been done on time hassle free. The Livepure technician explained me clearly by showing all filters inside.
I also added a pre filter to reduce maintenance.

The water taste is also pretty good. It’s the best in this price range",1
"So far my best purchase on Flipkart....it delivers on everything mentioned in its product capability brochure that is tasty, safe and clean water.....",1
"Good product, Value for money, Using it from last 2 years, First Year 3 Free services provided on time by authorized LivPure Engineer.
Bought this second for my neighbor in BBD @ 6079, They loved it.",1
on time delivery and on time installation. Installation engineer did not try to oversell any other accessories and was a pleasant experience. machine itself is looks well built though made of plastic. all the required tubing were included with the set. water tasted just like bottled water from Kinley,1
"It's been 2 months I have purchased this order for RS 7139 including no cost emi as I am fully satisfied with the installation and quality of the water as it was awesome.
I have tested the inlet and outlet flow.
inlet flow : 650
outlet flow:40
waste flow: 700
Even though I am using borewell water it has sand particles so I purchased pre filter 600rs extra for this for the life span of purifier.

Actually I was so interested in purchasing Kent ace plus but after so many analysis on this I purchased in doubt but it was awesome and thank God I got nice one and fully satisfied with this.

if anyone is thinking like me then buy this for 7k without any doubt you will be amazed once you taste the water.",1
superb Item.... unbelievable filtering of water ..taste of water was so good...wastage water is 1:3 ...but it is not waste of water ....u may be used this water any place like wash & cleaning....thank x to flipkart for gave good item & time bound delivery...i was fully satisfied for livpure....,1
My water purifier received on 19 June and I'm writing this review on 29 Jun 2023 still my installation not done by the installation team it's my humble request do not buy this purifier,0
Overall product is not good. Company not giving any warranty on parts in AMC and parts are not working longer more than couple of months and itsvostly as well. Completely disappointed with the service and all.,0
"Don't recommend at all. Description shows 7 litre can, but don't think it is 7 litre can, you will get less than 5 litre water after filtration.",0
"Don't buy this product I'm getting 22-26 TDS level, its very dengerous for health",0
Within the year faced issue twice. Even under warrenty need to pay charges for filter problem. Not recommended to buy.,0
"Guys, I am giving you the honest review on this i got this product on 28 May last month and my RO TDS is 400 ppm now after using this LivPure it got decrease to 15 ppm which is very dangerous for human body I am still coordinating with LivPure as when they sent their installation guy Viswanath he said that the RO TDS will not go beyond 70 but now its 15 ppm. I will only give good rating if they will correct this as if i would have aware that TDS will decrease till 15 ppm i would not have taken this product.",0
"I am writing this review after 2months of use
The product is amazing with good taste in water.
Installation person could not answer any questions, he could only install the product that's it.

Please groom the installation people
He could not understand or answer any questions.
He was really very dirty.

We had yo clean entire kitchen table n floor because of his dirty feet.

Please do not take me wrong but people if groomed can improve. I did not tell him anything n paid for whatever work he did.",1
Very good next day morning on time delivery works perfectly .. taste of the water is good .. SATISFIED,1
awsome product.. RO UV UF is providing other company also but specially livpur is providing the extra feature TE (teast enhancer)is great seems like pure mineral water.. i highly recommend.. only unhappy with the shipping.. that done by delhivery.. it tooks around 15 days to delhivery the product.. i dont khow why?,1
"livpure service is excellent and flipkart is all time favorite. i divide this into points
1. water capacity is 7 liter which is good for small to medium family or even for large family it is sufficient
2. service from livpure is superb installation done within 1 day after delivery
3. water taste is pretty good because it has 7 stage of filtration RO+UV+UF+TASTE enhancer",1
lovely product installed very fast best in class loved it go for it with out a second thought,1
I have been using this product from past 7 months. I would just say this is an amazing product. the water taste is really good and machine is working perfect in all aspects. please go for it.,1
Worst experience. Poor quality product. Flipkart's quality of product and service has degraded.,0
